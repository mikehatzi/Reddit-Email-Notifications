# Reddit-Email-Notifications

This script was made to create a custom notification system for Reddit posts. It can be modified to change the subreddit browsed, the keywords searched, and the email address output. The script can be run on any computer supporting Python 3. A keyword search is made every 30 seconds when the script is running, but this can be adjusted within the script.
